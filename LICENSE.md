### License subject to change

Like many things in the life of a developer, things are subject to change. I like having the freedom to pick and choose as needed, to improvise, and to iterate. The following license terms may change over time without notice. Changes will be made by way of pull request to the original repository found at https://github.com/iandouglas/fundamentals

I never put my content behind a pay-wall or subscription service. If you find the content helpful, I will always accept donations for my efforts.

### Your alterations must be documented

Derivations of my work are okay (subject to terms in this document), but attribution must be made (see below), and you must also publish an ongoing list of changes to your work.

This original license text must accompany any derivative work, and will continue to apply to derivative works with no change to the license terms found here.

### Private Individuals

I'm glad you're here. If you're using this project to showcase your skills, please make your code public for employers to examine. At the very least, add the attribution statement to your code in some way if your project is publically hosted somewhere, in a manner that links back to this GitHub repository.

Attribution back to me and the origial repository would be super nice of you!

### Commercial and For-Profit Entities, including For-Profit Education

I'm also really glad you're here. 

If you are a commercial entity, for-profit organization, or other kind of business who generates revenue or profit or gain of any sort including advertising revenue, please contact me BEFORE copying or quoting any content from my publication. Textual attribution to my publication is NOT sufficient if you generate revenue, profit, or gain by copying my work. This applies to written copies or quotes, audible quotes, or other reproductions.

If you find value in this project idea and would like to use it in any fashion, then [let's have a chat](mailto:ian.douglas@techinterview.guide) about a one-time license fee payble to "W. Ian Douglas" or "iandouglas.com LLC" so I can continue to make free content for others.

If you choose to use this project outline, whether or not you modify it, you are required to give public attribution back to this repository and to me, by name, in a format that looks like this:

- Project inspiration by W. Ian Douglas, https://github.com/iandouglas/fundamentals


### Non-Profit Groups and Non-Profit Education Groups

If your non-profit group or school wish to use this project as part of their curriculum, please [ask permission first](mailto:ian.douglas@techinterview.guide), and send your students directly to [this repository and community](https://github.com/iandouglas/fundamentals). I have always been generous to non-profit entities, but I ask that you contact me ahead of time. I would be pleased to speak with your staff about how to begin this project and maintain it on an ongoing basis.

While I do understand wanting to keep your own students contained in your own community, there's a much broader base of knowledge out there for others to help, mentorship opportunities, and cultural diversity, when your students can join another community.
